# System of Student Data

This is a system that stores Student data, allows the user to search a student by ID/name as well as allow them to change a students major. 

## Description

The Student file is in charge of creating one singular student and representing them,
the student application goes on to create an array to store all of the students you wish to add. In this specific circumstance, 
the input file added will contain predefined students that the application will read and store.
You can go on to reference them or change elements about these students, and all will be displayed in the beginning of each iteration.
The StudentNotFoundException file is there to handle any checked exception.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies and Installing

* Please download Eclipse in order to run the program, and make sure all updates are properly installed.
* The folder should be opened in Eclipse, where all the code should be found within the source code (src) file.

### Executing program

* First you must select the file titled "StudentApplication.java."
* Press run while on the Application file, you do not need to do this for any others. 

## Help

Make sure the input file shares the same file along with the source code, but not within it.
